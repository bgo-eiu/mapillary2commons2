This is intended to be an update to the Mapillary2Commons2 that can interface with Mapillary API v4. API v4 is missing an option to query for the username of the uploader to due a broad requirement applied by Facebook not to expose usernames. This is contradictory to Mapillary photos being licensed under the CC BY SA 4.0 license. This just shows an embed with the username in the corner so you can type it yourself.
